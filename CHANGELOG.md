# Changelog

## v0.1.17
- Implemented "Bounty Boosts" dynamic pricing mechanism.
- Created `/api/v1/missions/[id]/boost` endpoint enabling companies to increment an active mission's `price_per_minute` payout by 20%.
- Updated the Company Dashboard UI to include a "Bounty Boost" quick-action button on active mission cards.

## v0.1.16
- Laid the frontend UI groundwork for Phase 8 Synthetic Data Pipelines.
- Added interactive "Generate Depth Maps" and "Generate Segmentation Masks" upsell buttons directly to the Dataset cards on the Company Dashboard.

## v0.1.15
- Implemented **Creator Trust Tiers**.
- Updated Prisma schema to include a `trust_tier` field on the `User` model.
- Refactored `worker.ts` and `src/app/api/v1/admin/submissions/[id]/review/route.ts` to share the `acceptSubmissionAndTriggerDownstream` logic.
- The BullMQ worker now automatically accepts submissions that pass auto-QC if the uploading Creator is Tier 2 or higher, completely bypassing the manual Admin review queue and immediately triggering dataset generation, webhooks, and payouts.
- Updated the Creator Dashboard UI to proudly display the user's current Trust Tier.

## v0.1.14
- Implemented fast, fail-open Edge Middleware validation in `src/middleware.ts` to immediately block malformed API keys before hitting the Node.js event loop or Database connections.
- Added comprehensive React Error Boundaries (`src/app/error.tsx` and `src/app/global-error.tsx`) to catch unhandled runtime crashes gracefully, providing the user with recovery options rather than a raw server stack trace.

## v0.1.13
- Installed the `@google/genai` SDK for Vision-Language Model integration.
- Implemented `generateVideoLabels` in `src/lib/services/vlm-processor.ts` as a stub interface to the Gemini 2.0 Flash API to generate automated `action_summary`, `objects`, and `environment` labels from video frames.
- Updated `worker.ts` to dynamically fetch labels from the VLM processor during normalization, with graceful fallbacks to the MVP mock labels if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing or the external API call fails.

## v0.1.12
- Added `webhook_url` and `webhook_secret` fields to the `Mission` Prisma schema.
- Built a secure `dispatchWebhook` service that signs POST payloads with SHA-256 HMAC for company verification.
- Integrated asynchronous webhook dispatching into the Admin review route whenever a submission is accepted.
- Updated the Company Dashboard UI to allow setting optional webhook configurations during Mission creation.

## v0.1.11
- Created new `/api/v1/company/analytics` endpoint leveraging Prisma aggregations (`groupBy`, `aggregate`) to compute dataset volumes, total capital deployed, and submission status distributions.
- Overhauled the `CompanyDashboard` UI:
  - Added a Recharts Pie Chart to visualize the Mission Pipeline status distribution.
  - Added a KPI metric for Total Capital Deployed.
  - Refined the aesthetics of the Dataset Volumes Bar Chart and all dashboard cards.

## v0.1.10
- Integrated `@playwright/test` for robust, headless End-to-End (E2E) testing.
- Configured `playwright.config.ts` to spin up the local Next.js dev server automatically and execute tests against Chromium.
- Added foundational E2E test suite (`e2e/home.spec.ts`) validating homepage DOM rendering and core navigation links.

## v0.1.9
- Created the `/api/v1/creator/submissions/[id]/video` route to securely issue presigned S3 URLs to creators for their own past uploads.
- Enhanced the `CreatorDashboard` UI with a new "Recent Submissions" section featuring a dynamic `CreatorVideoPlayer`, allowing creators to stream their submitted videos and review payout statuses.
- Polished the Creator dashboard UI with improved responsive layouts and status indicators.

## v0.1.8
- Cleaned up root directory by archiving multi-agent instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.) into a dedicated `docs/agents/` folder.
- Refactored core integration utilities (`storage.ts`, `payments.ts`, `queue.ts`) into a new `src/lib/services/` directory to streamline the `lib` folder.
- Updated import paths globally to reflect the structural refactoring.

## v0.1.7
- Refactored `worker.ts` FFprobe extraction logic into a pure, testable utility (`src/lib/video-processor.ts`).
- Expanded the Vitest suite with unit tests verifying FFprobe metadata extraction (resolution, duration, fps).
- Completed the final remaining low-priority task from the MVP roadmap.

## v0.1.6
- Implemented `Dockerfile.worker` to allow the BullMQ video processor to be deployed and scaled independently of the Next.js web application.
- Added `/api/v1/admin/submissions/[id]/video` route to securely issue presigned S3 URLs to administrators for raw submission reviews.
- Enhanced the `AdminDashboard` UI by replacing placeholder blocks with live `<video>` elements that dynamically fetch these secure presigned URLs.

## v0.1.5
- Integrated `swagger-jsdoc` and `swagger-ui-react`.
- Added JSDoc OpenAPI annotations to `/api/v1/missions` and `/api/v1/datasets/[id]/manifest` routes.
- Exposed a dynamic OpenAPI JSON endpoint at `/api/v1/docs`.
- Created an interactive Swagger UI developer portal at `/docs`.

## v0.1.4
- Integrated `fluent-ffmpeg` and `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` into the BullMQ background worker.
- Replaced hardcoded dummy video metadata with real FFprobe extraction against the uploaded video streams.

## v0.1.3
- Replaced mocked Stripe integrations with the official Stripe Node.js SDK.
- The `src/app/api/v1/creator/onboarding/route.ts` now uses `stripe.accountLinks.create` for real Connect Express onboarding.
- The `processPayouts` utility in `src/lib/payments.ts` now triggers real transfers to connected accounts via `stripe.transfers.create`, handling cents conversion and error states.

## v0.1.2
- Integrated `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`.
- Removed mocked local URLs (`mock-storage.com`) from upload and dataset manifest routes.
- The `generateUploadUrl` and `generateDownloadUrl` functions now issue real temporary, signed credentials against standard S3-compatible endpoints.

## v0.1.1
- Restructured global project documentation (VISION, ROADMAP, IDEAS, TODO, MEMORY, DEPLOY).
- Defined Agent instructions across all major LLM profiles.
- Integrated `VERSION` file display into the global layout footer.
- Mapped mocked integrations to prepare for Phase 3 development.

## v0.1.0
- Initial MVP Launch.
- Set up DB, Queues, RBAC, API routes, and rate-limiting.
