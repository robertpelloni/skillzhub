# TODO List

### High Priority
- [x] Replace `https://mock-storage.com` mocks in `src/app/api/v1/datasets/[id]/manifest/route.ts` and `init-upload` route with real S3 Signed URL generation.
- [ ] Replace Stripe Connect onboarding and transfer mocks in `src/lib/payments.ts` and `src/app/api/v1/creator/onboarding/route.ts`.
- [ ] Write a Dockerfile specifically for running `worker.ts` independently of the Next.js web process for cloud deployments.

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement actual video metadata extraction (resolution, duration, fps) inside the worker job processor.
- [ ] Setup OpenAPI (Swagger) spec generation using a library like `swagger-jsdoc` to document the API surface automatically.
- [ ] Replace placeholder videos in the Admin review UI with actual presigned URLs pointing to the raw storage bucket.

### Low Priority
- [ ] Expand Vitest test suite to cover all Prisma schemas and background worker logic.
